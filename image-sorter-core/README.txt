  What is it?
  -----------

  ImageSorter is a software for reading images files, order and calculate
  the filenames by a specified algorithm and write it back to the filesystem
  or rename the original image files in the same way. So with this little tool
  you can order your image files i.e. by the absorption time set by your
  camera.
